name: release of cytochrome c from mitochondria
namespace: biological_process
def: "The process that results in the movement of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol, which is part of the apoptotic signaling pathway and leads to caspase activation." [GOC:add, GOC:mah, GOC:mtg_apoptosis, ISBN:0721639976, PMID:12925707, PMID:9560217]
comment: The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is a central event in the signaling phase of the apoptotic process, and it is often used by researchers to monitor this type of cell death. Any event that induces apoptosis will at some point induce the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Therefore, this term should only be used to annotate gene products that are directly involved in this process.

comment: Note that this term is intended to cover the insertion of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax or its homologs into mitochondrial membranes which occurs as an early step in the apoptotic program.

def: "A programmed cell death process which begins when a cell receives an internal (e.g. DNA damage) or external signal (e.g. an extracellular death ligand), and proceeds through a series of biochemical events (signaling pathways) which typically lead to rounding-up of the cell, retraction of pseudopodes, reduction of cellular volume (pyknosis), chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis), plasma membrane blebbing and fragmentation of the cell into apoptotic bodies. The process ends when the cell has died. The process is divided into a signaling pathway phase, and an execution phase, which is triggered by the former."

def: "Cell death in a host resulting from activation of host endogenous cellular processes after direct or indirect interaction with a symbiont (defined as the smaller of two, or more, organisms engaged in symbiosis, a close interaction encompassing mutualism through parasitism). An example of direct interaction is contact with penetrating hyphae of a fungus; an example of indirect interaction is encountering symbiont-secreted molecules." [GOC:pamgo_curators]
comment: Note that this term is to be used to annotate gene products in the host, not the symbiont. To annotate gene products in the symbiont that induce programmed cell death in the host, consider the biological process term 'induction by symbiont of host programmed cell death ; GO:0052044'.

comment: This term can be used to annotate gene products involved in apoptotic events happening downstream of the cross-talk point between the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. The cross-talk starts when caspase-8 cleaves Bid and truncated Bid interacts with mitochondria. From this point on it is not possible to distinguish between extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.

comment: For dependence receptors, withdrawal of a ligand from the receptor acts as a signal. Also, proteins involved in apoptosis induced via growth factor withdrawal, such as NGF, should be annotated to this term, even though traditionally apoptosis induced via growth factor withdrawal has been classified as an instance of intrinsic apoptosis. See an example in PMID:19767770.

def: "A stage of the apoptotic process that starts with the controlled breakdown of the cell through the action of effector caspases or other effector molecules (e.g. cathepsins, calpains etc.). Key steps of the execution phase are rounding-up of the cell, retraction of pseudopodes, reduction of cellular volume (pyknosis), chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis), plasma membrane blebbing and fragmentation of the cell into apoptotic bodies. The execution phase ends when the cell has died." [GOC:mtg_apoptosis]

comment: This term was created as a generic parent to group terms indicating occurrences of apoptotic process in specific cell types. The process of apoptosis may not vary, but the cell type does. Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation QC. Alternatively, you may annotate to the parent term GO:0006915 apoptotic process.

comment: This relation is currently used to connect two regulation processes p1 and p2, such that if r1 regulates p1 and r2 regulates p2, and r1 results_in r2 then the regulation of p1 is required for the regulation of p2. For an example of use, see GO:0035958 'regulation of glyoxylate cycle by regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter'. Note that a precise definition of this relation is under discussion. After it has been formalized it will be added to RO, where it will have a RO ID. Note that the existing identifier and label are subject to change.
